# NitroTest

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.6.

## Packages install

Run `npm install` in the root folder

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
The application uses **Angular in-memory-web-api** (https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/master/packages/misc/angular-in-memory-web-api). 
So you don't need to run any node server.


## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
